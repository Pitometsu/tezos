# These are the commands one must use to bake things:

# To build and install the ledger:
cd obsidian-scripts/ledger
./build.sh
./install.sh # Make sure that you have proper permissions to access the device in /dev

# Go into the root directory of tezos repo
nix-shell obsidian-scripts/sandbox.nix
tezos-sandbox-theworks.sh

# When you're done (or before you start again) to clean up and start
# over with a new sandbox:
killall tezos-client
killall tezos-node
rm -rf sandbox

# To see progress
tail -F sandbox/clientd-bootstrap1.log

# Once you have a ledger app, you can bake through the ledger as well:
# Make sure your ledger is plugged in and has the app running

tezos-sandbox-client.sh import ledger secret key my-ledger ed25519
tezos-sandbox-client.sh transfer 3000000 from bootstrap5 to my-ledger
tezos-sandbox-client.sh set delegate for my-ledger to my-ledger
tezos-sandbox-client.sh launch daemon my-ledger -B -E -D

# To check balances:
tezos-sandbox-client.sh get balance for my_ledger
