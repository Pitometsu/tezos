# These are the commands one must use to bake things:

# Terminal A
source obsidian-scripts/standalone-sandbox.inc.sh
theworks # This runs forever, is a bunch of nodes trying to bake (initially nothing)

# To build the ledger:
cd ledger
./build.sh
./install.sh # Make sure that you have proper permissions to access the device in /dev

# Once you have a ledger app, you can bake through the ledger as well:
# Make sure your ledger is plugged in and has the app running
source obsidian-scripts/standalone-sandbox.inc.sh
client import ledger secret key my-ledger ed25519
client transfer 3000000 from bootstrap5 to my-ledger
client set delegate for my-ledger to my-ledger
client launch daemon my-ledger -B -E -D

# To check balances:
watch_money
client get balance for my_ledger
